# PlunderedSeasGame
This was a game I made in a single weekend for a history class. 

You can move around with the 'a' and 'd' keys and fire your cannons by clicking. You win when you destroy enough ships. It's very buggy.

Development was circa September 2012. Used SDL 1 for input, graphics and sound.
